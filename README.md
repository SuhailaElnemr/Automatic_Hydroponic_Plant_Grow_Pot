# **Automatic Plant Grow Pot ðŸŒ±ðŸ’§**
This project showcases an Automatic Hydroponic Plant Grow Pot system designed to automate the growth of plants using hydroponic techniques. The system leverages sensors and microcontrollers to monitor and adjust key environmental factors such as water, enabling optimal plant growth with minimal manual intervention.  
## **Key Features:**
- **Automated Watering System:** Monitors soil moisture and supplies water as needed, ensuring plants stay hydrated without overwatering.

## **Applications:**
- Ideal for small-scale urban gardening, home growers, and hobbyists looking to cultivate plants without soil.
- Can be expanded for larger-scale hydroponic farming systems.
